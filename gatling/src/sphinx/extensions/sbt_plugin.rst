SBT plugin
##########

This SBT plugin integrates Gatling with SBT, allowing to use Gatling as a testing framework.

Versions
========

Check out available available versions on `Bintray <https://bintray.com/gatling/sbt-plugins/gatling-sbt/view#>`.

Beware that milestones (M versions) are undocumented and releases for Gatling customers.

Setup
=====

Snapshots are available on Sonatype.

In ``project/plugins.sbt``, add::

  addSbtPlugin("io.gatling" % "gatling-sbt" % "2.1.7")

You'll also need those two dependencies::

  "io.gatling.highcharts" % "gatling-charts-highcharts" % "2.1.7" % "test"
  "io.gatling"            % "gatling-test-framework"    % "2.1.7" % "test"

And then, in your ``.scala`` build::

  import io.gatling.sbt.GatlingPlugin

  lazy val project = Project(...)
                     .enablePlugins(GatlingPlugin)
                     .settings(libraryDependencies ++= /* Gatling dependencies */)


or in your ``.sbt`` file, for SBT up to 0.13.5::

  val test = project.in(file("."))
    .enablePlugins(GatlingPlugin)
    .settings(libraryDependencies ++= /* Gatling dependencies */)


or for 0.13.6 and later::

  enablePlugins(GatlingPlugin)

  libraryDependencies ++= /* Gatling dependencies */


Usage
=====

As with any SBT testing framework, you'll be able to run Gatling simulations using SBT standard ``test``, ``testOnly``, ``testQuick``, etc... tasks.

'Test' vs 'Integration Tests' configurations
============================================

This plugin offers two different custom SBT configurations, named ``Gatling`` and ``GatlingIt``.
They are tied to different sources directories (see next section for more details) and therefore allow to separate your simulations according to your needs, should you desire it.

Ideally:

* Your simulations with low injection profiles, which may serve as functional tests, should live in 'src/test' (the default source directory for the ``Gatling`` configuration), and run along your unit tests, since they would complete quickly
* Longer, more complex simulations with high injection profiles, should live in 'src/it' (the default source directory for the ``GatlingIt`` configuration) and be run on a as-needed basis.

Also, since they're tied to separate SBT configurations, your SBT settings can then be customized per configuration.
You can expect a relatively short simulation to run easily with the default JVM settings, but simulations with much higher load can very well require an increase of the max heap memory allowed for example).

.. note::

  When using the ``GatlingIt`` configuration, you must prefix the various tasks and settings you may want to use by ``it``, e.g. ``test`` becomes ``it:test``, etc...

Default settings
================

For the ``Gatling`` configuration :

* By default, Gatling simulations must be in ``src/test/scala``, configurable using the ``scalaSource in Gatling`` setting.
* By default, Gatling reports are written to ``target/gatling``, configurable using the ``target in Gatling`` setting.

For the ``GatlingIt`` configuration :

* By default, Gatling simulations must be in ``src/it/scala``, configurable using the ``scalaSource in GatlingIt`` setting.
* By default, Gatling reports are written to ``target/gatling-it``, configurable using the ``target in GatlingIt`` setting.

Additional tasks
================

Gatling's SBT plugin also offers four additional tasks:

* ``startRecorder``: starts the Recorder, configured to save recorded simulations to the location specified by ``scalaSource in Gatling`` (by default, ``src/test/scala``).
* ``generateReport``: generates reports for a specified report folder.
* ``lastReport``: opens by the last generated report in your web browser. A simulation name can be specified to open the last report for that simulation.
* ``copyConfigFiles``: copies Gatling's configuration files (gatling.conf & recorder.conf) from the bundle into your project resources if they're missing.
* ``copyLogbackXml``: copies Gatling's default logback.xml.

Overriding JVM options
======================

Gatling's SBT plugin uses the same default JVMÂ options as the bundle launchers or the Maven plugin, which should be sufficient for most simulations.
However, should you need to tweak them, you can use ``overrideDefaultJavaOptions`` to only override those default options, without replacing them completely.

E.g., if you want to tweak Xms/Xmx to give more memory to Gatling::

  javaOptions in Gatling := overrideDefaultJavaOptions("-Xms1024m", "-Xmx2048m")
