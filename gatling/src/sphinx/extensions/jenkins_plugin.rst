Jenkins plugin usage
====================

Documentation of Gatling Jenkins plugin is available on `jenkins-ci wiki <https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gatling+Plugin>`_

How it works
============

Even if the Jenkins plugin was built with the Maven plugin in mind, using it is not mandatory to be able to archive reports and track your results with the Jenkins plugin.

The Jenkins plugin looks into your job's workspace for any simulation report it can find, and archives only reports that hasn't been archived yet (meaning that you don't need to clean your workspace to delete previous reports).

As long as you are able to configure a job that will launch Gatling, execute a simulation and generate a report in your job's workspace (using the Maven plugin, SBT, a shell script or whatever), you're good to go !

However, note that the Jenkins plugin relies on the report folder's naming convention *runname-rundate* (ex: mysimulation-201305132230). You must not change the report folder's name in order to get the Jenkins plugin to work.
