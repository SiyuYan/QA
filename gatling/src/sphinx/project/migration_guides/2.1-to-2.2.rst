Migrating from 2.1 to 2.2

Global changes
==============

* The format of a few configuration properties in gatling.conf has changed and must be updated to its new form.

  Where the values took the form ``"value1, value2, value3"``, it must be changed to : ``[value1, value2, value3]``.

  This impacts three configuration properties :

  * ``gatling.http.ahc.httpsEnabledProtocols`` : by default ``""``, now ``[]``
  * ``gatling.http.ahc.httpsEnabledCipherSuites`` : by default ``""``, now ``[]``
  * ``gatling.data.writers`` : by default ``"console, file"``, now ``[console, file]``
